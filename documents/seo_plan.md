--- SEO notes with Aaron Katz: ---
SEO, search engine optimization, helps make your website more visible to users of search engines, by formatting data in a way that allows web crawlers to rank your site. For instance, having redundant / non-semantic tags, or poorly hidden content will cause your score and page relevance to decrease. Linking to other quality, active sites with high SEO also increases your organic traffic. SEO seeks to provide the searcher with the highest value links and pages. Some people avoid clicking sponsored links, some click them maliciously.

analytics, such as google analytics, can show you info about user traffic on pages. you'll have to incorporate code on pages to have this functionality. when complete, it can provide you with feedback to guide your page design/ux decisions. this tool will show where your users are looking, clicking, hovering, with heatmaps, and can help you see where to place the content to increase conversions.

LLMs and ChatGPT are gaining traction as tools for developers in the evolving tech landscape. While the role of development is not currently in danger of being completely replaced, it's evident that some tasks are being completed mostly by "AI" software, with some auditing by experienced developers. ChatGPT is currently being used to create text summaries, to give feedback on created content, to achieve a simplified version of a thought-leader's lecture, and to simplify creation of code that extracts html elements.

chatgpt can create featured snippets really strongly, good use case for succinct summaries or body/copy text.

enhance seo by gaining feedback content by querying an LLM. ChatGPT is not only a content creator- it can give feedback on content. Give it an article and ask how to make it better. Other options to check out include faqs, commonly experienced problems, pros/cons, and other suggestions/use guides queried from the ai personal assistant.

One can also enhance their knowledge base with ChatGPT. Have gpt to speedrun the article "explain like i'm in highschool" to democratize thought leaders' content.


"Screaming frog" extractions? Extract elements from a page simply; the method is to just plug in html to extract, and screaming frog will create an x-path to simplify prompts.

It's possible to create custom tools with ChatGPT. Empower yourself to create chrome extensions.


LLMs/ChatGPT can eliminate the need for a dev to have a "read the room" module installed. even for devs who bring strong media and cultural literacy to the organization, LLM/GPT are aggregating the highest, lowest and median literacies at all times. 

The corresponding criticism is obvious- generative AI cannot pinpoint niche value in an organic and dynamic setting. It will remain just behind the curve, but this should only be a concern for the cutting edge 20% of designers and developers of goods and services. However, the generative AI is likely to be taught to learn and predict trends to cut into this 20% market.

--- My plans for seo implementation: ---
1 add metadata to each page
2 add valuable links, at least 2 links per page to our blog or about page to provide relevant content that we've generated in a timely fashion. add at least 2 links per page to pages of valued partner sites. consider placing links to sponsored pages when we have established monthly traffic to our pages
3 ask customer to pay for google adwords/analytics and provide ROI estimation in their market
