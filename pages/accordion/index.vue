      The charter boat may need permits to fish in federal waters. For example, a Gulf
      Charter/Headboat for Reef Fish For-Hire Fishing Permit requires a Vessel EEZ
      application, valid state registration, and payment of application fees.
      Safety plan
      The charter boat should have a safety plan and safety equipment on board.
